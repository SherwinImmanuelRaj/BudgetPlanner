Budget Planning App - Data Storage
=====================================

This folder contains the data files for the Budget Planning App.

Files that may be created here:
- budget-data.json: Main budget data backup file
- theme-settings.json: Theme preferences backup

The app primarily uses localStorage for data persistence, but also creates backup files in this folder for data portability and backup purposes.

Note: Since this is a client-side application, data files are downloaded to this folder when you save data using the browser's download functionality.
